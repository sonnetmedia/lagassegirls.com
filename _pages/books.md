> “Jilly and Jessie Lagasse have gone and done it. They’ve taken the warm, soulful food that connects them to their Dad and translated it into the language of gluten-free, so that we may have the pleasure of sharing both the food and the love, safely, with our own families. Thank you, Lagasse Girls!”  
— Nicole Hunn, author of Gluten-Free on a Shoestring , on The Gluten-Free Table
