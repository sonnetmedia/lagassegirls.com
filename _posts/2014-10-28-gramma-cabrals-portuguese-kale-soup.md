  Many of our soup recipes are a pure food memory for us.  This recipe from Great-Gramma takes us back to our childhood in Somerset, a small town just south of Boston. Anytime we would visit our Great-Gramma we knew there was something delicious brewing in her kitchen! Tell us what are some of your food memories?

  Makes 6 to 8 servings
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Ingredients:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  2 tablespoons olive oil
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1 pound chorizo sausage, halved lengthwise, then halved crosswise, and diced into chunks (we like Gaspar’s Portuguese chouriço)
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1 cup chopped yellow onion
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1 tablespoon minced garlic
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Generous pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1 pound well-rinsed, stemmed kale, chopped into C-inch strips
</p>

<p class="p1">
  2 bay leaves
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Directions:
</p>

<p class="p1">
  1 pound baking potatoes, peeled and diced (D cups)
</p>

<p class="p1">
  12 to 14 cups chicken or vegetable stock (preferably low-sodium)
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">1. </span>In an 8-quart stockpot, warm the olive oil over medium heat.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">2. </span>Add the chorizo, onions, garlic, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Stir
</p>

<p class="p1">
  and cook until the onions soften, about 4 to 6 minutes.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">3. </span>Add half of the kale and cook down until it’s a third of its size, stirring constantly, about 3 to 4 minutes. Then add the other half and cook down as well.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">4. </span>Once the kale has cooked down, add the bay leaves, a bit of salt and pepper, the potatoes, and the stock. Stir well.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">5. </span>Turn the heat up to high and bring to a gentle boil. Then turn the heat down to low. Cook uncovered for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are cooked through but not mushy.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">6. </span>Once the potatoes are cooked through, reseason with more salt and pepper or crushed red pepper flakes to your desired taste. Turn off the heat and serve immediately with your favorite gluten-free roll or baguettes. We love Gillian’s French rolls or Udi’s French baguettes. You can use margarine—or butter. We won’t tell Great-Gramma!
