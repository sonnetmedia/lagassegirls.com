        Christmas is almost upon us and we know you are about to have a full house.The guests are about to be rolling in if they haven&#8217;t already. We also know you&#8217;ll have loads of other things to spend your time worrying about, so why make breakfast one of them?? We have 2 fab breakfast recipes from our new book that are just the thing to simplify your holiday breakfast life and deliciously at that. Here is one of our faves, Jessie&#8217;s French Toast Bake. If you have a dairy issue like Jilly does, simply substitute So Delicious&#8217;s Coconut Milk Creamer in any flavor you prefer for the milk and cream. For the butter sub either a vegan/dairy free butter sub or coconut oil, keeping in mind a little goes a long way w/ coconut oil! So 1/3 cup might be plenty. We prefer the brand Skinny Coconut Oil….yum!

        The beauty of this is it can be made a day ahead of time or prepped and cooked straight away. We like to let it sit overnight, which gives the bread a chance to soak up all the yummy egg mixture. Either way works and tastes fantastic! Enjoy and Happy Holidays, J & J x

              STEPS:

            <h6>
            </h6>
            
            <div>
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">1. Preheat the oven to 350°F if you are planning to make and bake the French </span>toast immediately.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">2. Grease a 13 x 9-inch baking dish with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Layer </span>the sliced bread evenly in the pan. We needed two rows when we tested this recipe.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and </span>cinnamon together. Once homogeneous, pour the mixture evenly over the top of the bread slices in the baking dish.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">4. If you are making the French toast to be baked later, cover the dish tightly </span>with plastic wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. If baking immediately, proceed to step 6.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">5. If you premade the French toast and are now ready to bake it, remove it from </span>the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350°F.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">6. Now it is time to make your crumble topping. In a small mixing bowl, mix </span>together the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg until evenly distributed.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">7. Using a fork, mash in the softened butter until small crumbles form. Depend</span>ing on the type of flour blend you use, you may have to add a bit more flour to get even crumbles and that is okay!
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">8. Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the top of the French toast.</span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">9. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your preferred texture; 45 minutes will result in a softer texture, while a 1-hour cook time will yield a firmer texture. Remove from oven. </span>
              </p>
              
              <p>
                <span style="color: #000000;">10. Cover with syrup or confectioners’ sugar (or both), if desired, and enjoy!</span>
