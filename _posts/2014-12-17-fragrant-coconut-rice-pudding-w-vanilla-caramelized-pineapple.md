Here as requested and promised is our Lagasse Girls take on the ol&#8217; classic, Rice Pudding. We had a great amount of feedback at our recent Holiday Facebook Party with Delight Gluten Free Magazine and Schar Gluten Free!! One of the ladies requested a recipe for rice pudding for the holidays….so naturally we had to share. The beauty with this is you really can customize it to suit your tastes and also the holidays…..maybe add some cinnamon and nutmeg as well or sub the pineapple out for apples or rhubarb? We know you&#8217;re going to love this. If you are going to go with the pineapple, fresh really is best here. You want the natural sugars in order to properly caramelize.

Happy Holidays to you all and thanks for all the fab feedback, J & J x

*Dairy Free Recipe

&nbsp;

Serves 4

&nbsp;

INGREDIENTS:

&nbsp;

1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes or shredded coconut

1 + 3/4 cups cold water

1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk, preferably light

1/3 cup granulated sugar or coconut sugar

1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom

1 teaspoon vanilla extract, divided

2/3 cup jasmine rice, rinsed well

1 cup bite size cubes fresh pineapple (about 1/2 pound)

1 tablespoon firmly packed light brown sugar

&nbsp;

STEPS:

&nbsp;

1. Preheat the oven to 350 Degrees F.

2. Spread the coconut flakes evenly onto a baking sheet. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes, or until light golden brown, keeping a watchful eye not to burn them, which happens quickly! Set aside and let cool on the pan.

3. In a small saucepan, combine the cold water, coconut milk, sugar,cardamom, and 1/2 teaspoon of the vanilla extract.

4. Over low heat, warm gently and stir until the sugar dissolves, 4 to 5 minutes. Then turn the heat up to medium high and bring to a gently boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and simmer gently, stirring often, for a final 3 to 4 minutes.

5. In a medium saucepan, add the rice and ladle in half of the warmed coconut milk mixture. Over medium-low heat, bring this to a simmer, stirring until all the liquid has been absorbed, 6 to 8 minutes.

6. Once absorbed, repeat the process with the remaining half of the coconut milk mixture, stirring constantly, until the mixture has been absorbed. Continue cooking, uncovered, on medium-low heat until the rice is tender, for about 15 minutes. This can take a bit longer depending on the brand of rice you use. You want it to be similar to rice pudding or a gooey, risotto like texture.

7. Once cooked through, turn off the heat, cover and set aside to cool to room temperature. Once at room temperature, chill in the fridge for at least 20 minutes, covered.

8. Meanwhile, in a small bow, combine the fresh pineapple chunks, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and the brown sugar. Stir to coat the pineapple evenly.

9. In a medium, nonstick frying pan over medium heat, add the pineapple mixture and cook until warm and the sugar starts to caramelize, 4 to 6 minutes, flipping occasionally so all the sides are caramelized. Remove from heat.

10. Divide the cooled pudding among bowls or glasses of your choice. Spoon a bit of the warmed caramelized pineapple on top and then sprinkle on a bit of the toasted coconut flakes. Enjoy slightly warm or chilled.
