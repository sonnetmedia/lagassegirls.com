title: Garlic Pork with Oriental Salad
author: The Lagasse Girls
excerpt: We seem to have loads of scrumptious recipes in the book that are capable of feeding a small army. But what about the nights when it’s just the two of you and neither of you really wants leftovers? For nights like these, here is the perfect meal for two. This dish just dances on your palate with the tang, the sweet, the spice. Not only is it packed full of your recommended five-a-day fruit and vegetable servings, but it is quite filling as well. If you don’t like pineapple, substitute any variety of orange you enjoy, or feel free to barbecue the pork without it or add thinly sliced matchsticks of apple to the salad for a different twist. If you want a more filling take on this dish, serve some cooked rice noodles or steamed rice alongside.

*Serves 2*

We seem to have loads of scrumptious recipes in the book that are capable of feeding a small army. But what about the nights when it’s just the two of you and neither of you really wants leftovers? For nights like these, here is the perfect meal for two. This dish just dances on your palate with the tang, the sweet, the spice. Not only is it packed full of your recommended five-a-day fruit and vegetable servings, but it is quite filling as well. If you don’t like pineapple, substitute any variety of orange you enjoy, or feel free to barbecue the pork without it or add thinly sliced matchsticks of apple to the salad for a different twist. If you want a more filling take on this dish, serve some cooked rice noodles or steamed rice alongside.

  * **Ingredients**
  * 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, plus additional if needed
  * 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
  * 2 lean pork chops, boneless variety preferred
  * 1 can (8 ounces) pineapple chunks, drained
  * 1 clove garlic, crushed
  * Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
  * 6 small radishes, thinly sliced
  * 1 cup sugar snap peas, sliced into long, thin strips (about 4 ounces)
  * 1 small head green bok choy, leaves finely chopped and stems finely shredded
  * ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
  * Salt and black pepper to taste
  * Juice and finely grated zest of one large lemon
  * 2 teaspoons gluten-free soy sauce or tamari
  * 2 teaspoons honey
  * 4 small green onions, sliced thin on the diagonal

**Steps**

  1. In a medium-size sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil and the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.
  2. Add the pork chops, pineapple chunks, garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, and salt and black pepper to taste. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes, turning the chops over once to make sure they are fully cooked through. If your pork is quite thick, it might take a few minutes longer to cook. If so, and if necessary, you can add more sesame oil to keep the ingredients from burning in the pan.
  3. Turn off the heat and cover the pan to keep warm.
  4. In a medium-size bowl, combine the radishes, sugar snap peas, bok choy and cilantro.
  5. In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil, lemon juice and zest, gluten-free soy sauce, and honey to make a dressing.
  6. Drizzle the dressing over the vegetables in the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, if desired, and toss well.
  7. While the pork is still warm, remove the chops from the pan to a cutting board and cut into thick slices, about 6 per chop, depending on size. Add to the bowl of salad, along with the pineapple chunks and juices from the pan.
  8. Add the green onions to the salad and toss all together well. Serve immediately.
