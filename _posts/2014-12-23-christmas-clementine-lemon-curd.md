These lil babies make wonderful gifts&#8230;.I mean who wouldn&#8217;t want a jar full of this deliciousness anytime of year? You can do anything with this yummy curd, which isn&#8217;t a curd at all but more like a decadent fruit spread. Think of it as jams naughtier cousin. Plus, you probably have loads of lil oranges lying round this time of year and what else are you going to do with them? We love this spread on top of our Cranberry Scones, but you could put it on toast, muffins, or try using it in a dessert&#8230;whatever you like.

This recipe will yield roughly 2 to 2 1/2 cups of curd. We used the baby mason jars for this, which is the perfect amount to give because a little goes a long way. So, this recipe gave us 4 full mini (125 mls) mason jars. You can double if need be. Once cooled this will need to be kept in the fridge and will be good for up to 2 months. We hope you like this as much as we do.

Makes 2 to 2 1/2 cups curd

&nbsp;

INGREDIENTS:

juice and zest of 3 meyer lemons and 3 clementines (you want 1 cup of juice) combined in a medium bowl

1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon corn starch

1 1/2 cups sugar

2 eggs

4 egg yolks

8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cubed

**\*you&#8217;ll also need mason jars, we used the baby 125 mills, sterilized thoroughly and properly prepped.\***

&nbsp;

STEPS:

1. Dissolve the corn starch in the juice and zest mixture till dissolved and no lumps remain. Add 1 cup of the sugar to this mixture and whisk together.

2. In a large bowl whisk the eggs and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar together till well combined. Add the juice mixture into this bowl and whisk all together well.

3. In a non-reactive, non-stick medium saucepan, add all of this mixture to the pan and bring to medium low heat, more low than medium. You don&#8217;t want it to bubble yet. Heat this until the sugar dissolves while whisking constantly to avoid the eggs breaking and curdling, about 3 to 4 minutes.

4. Working in batches of 3, add 1/3 of the cubed butter to the pan and whisk constantly until all the butter has melted. Once the first batch has melted add another 1/3 of the cubed butter, whisking constantly until melted. Repeat again until all the butter has been added and melted.

5. Once all the butter has melted, whisk for another 5 minutes. Everything should be smooth&#8230;.no bumps or lumps.

6. Bring up the heat to medium and allow the mixture to bubble gently while constantly whisking (yes you&#8217;re getting a good workout!). Once it starts to bubble and thicken, turn off the heat and keep whisking. You need it to bubble slightly in order for it to thicken properly. It should be nice and thick now, enough to coat the back of a spoon well.

7. Take off heat and allow to cool fully in the pan, whisking occasionally. It should be quite thick and velvety smooth.

8. Once cooled, decant in the prepared sterilized jars, seal and store in the fridge till needed.
