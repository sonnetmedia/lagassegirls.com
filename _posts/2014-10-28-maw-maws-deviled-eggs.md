Who doesn't like deviled eggs? This recipe is quick and easy and will take you 30 minutes or less.  We believe Maw-Maw's secret ingredients: cajun spices and relish really spices up this traditional recipe! You can easily make a larger quantity of eggs, if you want; just increase the other ingredients proportionally, and you should be fine!


**Makes 24 Pieces**


Ingredients:

12 large hard-cooked eggs, cooled and peeled  
2 teaspoons sweet relish  
1⁄4 teaspoon garlic powder  
1⁄2 teaspoon Emeril’s Original Essence seasoning or Cajun seasoning of your choice  
3 to 4 tablespoons mayonnaise, depending on your preference  
1 teaspoon dried parsley  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper (optional)  
Paprika, for garnish  


Directions:

1. Slice the cooled hard-cooked eggs in half lengthwise. Empty the yolks into a small mixing bowl and set the halves on your serving dish.


2. Add to the yolks the sweet relish, garlic powder, Essence, mayonnaise, and parsley. Mix the ingredients together until the yolks are mashed up and the filling is uniform. You can taste it here to see if you want to add any salt and/or pepper. Maw-Maw doesn’t, so we leave it up to you whether to add anything else!


3. Using a teaspoon, gently fill each egg white cup with the yolk filling. Once all the eggs are filled, sprinkle a small bit of paprika over the eggs for garnish. Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve.
