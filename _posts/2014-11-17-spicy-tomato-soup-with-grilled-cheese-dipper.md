This quick and easy soup is super tasty but easy to make. What’s better than that, right? This version starts with canned tomatoes and adds quite a kick, if so desired…much different than the bland but beloved version of our childhood (think Campbell’s!). We haven’t found a better baguette for this recipe than Against the Grain’s version, but feel free to use whatever French-style gluten-free loaf you like best. This can easily be made dairy-free by substituting your favorite dairy-free cheese and baguettes for the dippers.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></span>

**Soup**

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

2 cups chopped yellow onion

1 cup chopped green bell pepper

1 tablespoon minced garlic

4 cups chicken stock

2 (14.5-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes

1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar (optional)

&nbsp;

**Grilled Cheese Dippers**

2 loaves (approximately 16 ounces) gluten-free baguettes or French-style

bread (we like Against the Grain), at room temperature

1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for

the pan

8 to 12 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded (use more or less depending on

preference)

  1. First, prepare the soup. In a large stockpot, heat the olive oil over medium

heat. Add the onions and peppers and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring occasionally,

until the vegetables are soft and starting to brown slightly.

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Add the garlic and saute. briefly, for 30 seconds to a minute. Stir in all of the
  </li>
</ol>

remaining soup ingredients except the sugar, being sure to taste the soup before

adding additional salt, as some brands of canned tomatoes are already salted.

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Let simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, giving the flavors time to meld. If the soup
  </li>
</ol>

is too tart or tangy for your palate, add 1 to 2 teaspoons granulated sugar to take

some of the tang away.

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    While the soup simmers, prepare the dippers. Preheat the oven to 425ÅãF and
  </li>
</ol>

grease a large baking sheet.

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    Cut each baguette in half lengthwise. Then cut each half into quarters so you
  </li>
</ol>

have eight pieces total per baguette.

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    Using a butter knife, spread butter onto each piece and then arrange on the
  </li>
</ol>

baking sheet.

<ol start="7">
  <li>
    Top each with a generous amount of shredded Cheddar. Bake for 4 to 6 minutes,
  </li>
</ol>

or until the cheese is melted and the bread is crispy but not burned.

  <li>
    Ladle soup into bowls and serve with two to three grilled cheese dippers

each. Dip generously and often!
