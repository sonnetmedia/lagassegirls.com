These are so perfect for a Christmas Morning treat along with our Clementine and Lemon Curd. You can substitute any dried fruit you prefer, cherries or raisins perhaps, or some fresh blueberries would be delish too. These scones aren&#8217;t sweet, more like a biscuit in flavor, but that&#8217;s because they are meant to be topped with either the sweet curd or a jam. They are so quick and easy to make, so we hope these are in your breakfast future. We recommend Skinny Coconut Oil for all of our baking, we just love the results. Their coconut oil gives us moist scones with a lovely hint of coconut.  These are Gluten Free and Dairy Free, though if you don&#8217;t have a problem w/ dairy you could use real butter and milk. Enjoy.

Makes 8  1/4 cup scones

INGREDIENTS:

1 + 1/2 cups gluten free all purpose flour blend (we use Arrowhead Mills GF All Purpose Baking Mix)

1 teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon xanthan gum

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 cup dried cranberries, unsweetened if possible

1/4 cup coconut oil (or COLD unsalted butter, cubed) (we like Skinny Coconut Oil)

1/2 cup COLD dairy free milk (we used coconut milk, Lactaid works too)

1 medium egg, lightly beaten

&nbsp;

STEPS:

1. Preheat oven to 425 Degrees F.

2. Sift the flour, baking powder, xantan gum and salt together into a medium bowl. Stir in the dried cranberries.

3. Add the coconut oil into the bowl and, with your hands (CLEAN!), blend into the flour mixture until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Hands work much better here than a food processor for this.

4. Combine the milk and egg in a small bowl and whisk till both are well combined.

5. Add this mixture to the bowl of flour crumbs and mix well with either a fork, spoon or clean hands until all is well combined and you have a ball of dough.

6. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop out a 1/4 cup of the dough and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Using your hands or the back of the measuring cup, flatten and gently pat down each scone a bit. Repeat until all scones are on the pan and patted down.

7. Bake at 425 Degrees F on the middle rack of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the tops are golden brown. Serve warm with curd or jam, if desired.
