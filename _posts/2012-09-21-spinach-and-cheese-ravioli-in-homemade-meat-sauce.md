Once we discovered the delicious gluten free spinach and cheese ravioli Conte has made, we decided we needed to throw together a quick red sauce to make it a meal.  This simple yet veggie and meat packed option really compliments the ravioli well.  Just omit the meat for a vegetarian option!

  * Ingredients
  * 1-2 tbsp olive oil
  * 1 pound extra lean ground turkey or beef
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 zucchini, ends cut off and discarded, roughly chopped
  * 1 yellow summer squash, ends cut off and discarded, roughly chopped
  * 1 carrot, roughly diced
  * Any seasonings you prefer;  we&#8217;ve used a bit of Italian blend seasoning, pinch of crushed red chili flakes and freshly cracked black pepper
  * 1/4 cup good quality red wine of your choice (optional)
  * 3 cups (24 oz.) of Tomato Sauce or Pasatta,  No Salt Added preferably
  * 1 Package of Conte&#8217;s Gluten Free Wheat Free Spinach & Cheese Ravioli

Steps

  1. In a large, 8 quart pot, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat.
  2. Add the ground turkey or beef to the pot and brown until fully cooked through.
  3. Add the garlic, zucchini, squash, carrot, seasonings and the red wine to the pot. Stir well and let the wine cook out for 3-4 minutes.
  4. Turn the heat down to medium low and add the tomato sauce to the pot. Stir well and cook uncovered for 15 minutes.
  5. While the sauce is cooking, cook the raviolis to al dente as directed on package and put aside.
  6. Once the raviolis are cooked al dente and drained, pop them into the pot with the sauce.
  7. Gently stir them to ensure they are well coated.
  8. Serve and enjoy!
