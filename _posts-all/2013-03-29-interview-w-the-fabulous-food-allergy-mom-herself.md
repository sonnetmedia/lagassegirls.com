We were so honored to be asked to do an interview by the fabulous Food Allergy Mom, Ms. Kimberly, this past month. We are a BIG fan of hers and her wonderful blog page that is filled with delish recipes and helpful tips for an assortment of food allergies. She is no stranger to the Gluten Free life. She was inspired to start her blog when her own son was diagnosed with multiple severe, life-threatening food allergies in 2004.  She created the blog to offer parents and caregivers of children with food allergies a positive support network.   She has certainly done that, so follow the link below to check out our interview.  It also includes our fantastic recipe for our Jazzy Jambalaya, so try it for yourselves today! Wheat, gluten, dairy, nut AND soy free!! Boom, take that food allergies <img src="http://lagassegirls.dev/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> x
