  <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
</p>

2 cups buttermilk

8 to 10 dashes hot sauce (we like Tabasco or Crystal)

2 pounds chicken pieces (wings, thighs, breasts)

2 2⁄3 cups superfine white rice flour

1 1⁄3 cups cornstarch

2 tablespoons garlic powder

2 tablespoons salt

3 tablespoons Emeril’s Original Essence seasoning or Cajun seasoning of your choice

1⁄2 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Vegetable oil, for frying

**** ****

  1. In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the buttermilk and hot sauce. Add the chicken pieces and seal the bag firmly. Place the bag in a bowl and refrigerate for at least 3 hours but no more than 24 hours.
  2. When the chicken is done marinating, carefully transfer the buttermilk and chicken mixture into a large mixing bowl. Discard the plastic bag.
  3. Prepare the batter. In a large shallow bowl or casserole dish, combine the rice flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, salt, Essence, and cayenne. Mix them together with a fork or spoon until well combined.
  4. Set up a cooling rack or baking sheet on which to lay your battered chicken. Work piece by piece. Remove a piece of chicken from the buttermilk mixture and let the excess buttermilk drip off slightly before laying the chicken in the dry batter mixture.
  5. Coat the entire piece with a layer of the dry batter as evenly and as well as possible before laying the breaded chicken piece on either the cooling rack or the baking sheet. Repeat this process until all the chicken has been battered.
  6. If you want the regular one-breaded version, stop here. If you want the super-crunchy double-breaded version, repeat the battering process once more so that each chicken piece gets dipped into the buttermilk and dry batter a total of two times. Discard any remaining batter and buttermilk.
  7. Let your battered chicken sit at room temperature for 20 to 25 minutes while you prepare your frying station. If you are using a deep fryer, heat the oil and cook as directed according to manufacturer’s instructions.
  8. If frying on the stove, fill a large, deep frying pan or cast-iron skillet halfway with vegetable oil. Using a candy/deep-fry thermometer, heat the oil until it is between 350°F and 375°F. Once the temperature has been reached, carefully drop in a few pieces of the battered chicken, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fewer is better. After about 4 to 5 minutes, depending on the cuts of chicken you’ve used, carefully use tongs to turn the chicken pieces over and fry the other side for another 4 to 5 minutes. You MUST be sure the chicken is cooked through to an internal temperature of 165°F. Remove a test piece, check the temperature, and return the chicken to the pan to continue cooking, if necessary. We do not recommend trying to test the temperature while the chicken is immersed in the oil.
  9. Once fully cooked, remove the pieces by using tongs and place on a large, paper towel–lined plate or baking sheet to cool.
 10. Repeat the frying process until all the chicken pieces have been fried. Keep an eye on the thermometer and try not to let the oil temperature dip below the 350°F mark, paying special attention to the temperature right after you remove the finished chicken pieces and are getting ready to add new pieces.
 11. Let cool a few minutes before serving.
