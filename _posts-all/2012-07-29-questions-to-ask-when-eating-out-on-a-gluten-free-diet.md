Wowwie! If you are living on a gluten-free diet, then you know how scary it can be to go out to eat with friends or family! Any appetizer or dessert could mean your undoing. An innocent slice of flourless chocolate cake could result in hours or days of misery…YOU know what we mean!

It took us YEARS to get up the courage (and stamina sometimes) after our diagnoses to venture out into the world of restaurant dining again. These days, with increased awareness and sensitivity to people with celiac, it’s getting a bit easier to find a safe meal while out and about.<!--more--> Lots of chain restaurants profess to have gluten-free menu items and some restaurants are even opening that are completely gluten-free. BTW, check out our “Restaurants” tab for great dining out options and info!

So, you’ve worked up the courage and you’ve chosen a restaurant, now it’s time to actually ORDER something! We thought it’d be helpful to give you some important questions to ask before you decide to take your first bite.

  1. Before ordering, ask to speak directly to a manager or the chef (preferable). Tell him/her about your condition and ask if he/she can prepare your meal to your specifications. Also, ask what safeguards the restaurant has in place to prevent any cross contamination.
  2. Once you have narrowed down your menu selections, it’s time to inquire about the specifics such as: 
      1. Is my chosen entrée served with a sauce of any kind? Does it contain flour or another gluten source?
      2. Does the salad dressing contain any flour products or soy sauce (sometimes NOT gluten-free!)
      3. Is the item breaded or fried in oil that has been used for gluten-based frying?
  3. If the person with whom you are talking seems unaware of what cross-contamination is, you can also ask more specific questions like the following: 
      1. Will my fish be cooked on a grill shared with other gluten containing foods like breaded or marinated meats?
      2. Will my salad be made in a clean bowl or one that may have had a crouton-filled salad in it before?
  4. If the manager or chef balks at your requests or questions, LEAVE…unless you want to risk getting sick for the sake of your meal out. We have found that most restaurants, especially the upscale ones, want to be helpful and accommodate you. But you have to ASK!

Obviously, this is just a teeny tiny selection of questions you could ask when you are out. But, for us, these are usually the basic ones we need to ask to ascertain whether we should even go ahead with an order! If you or your family members have any experience with this or even if you have some ideas of other good questions to ask, please email us and we will add your suggestions to the site! Thanks!
