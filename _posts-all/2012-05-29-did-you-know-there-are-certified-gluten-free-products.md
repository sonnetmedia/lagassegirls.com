Most everyone has jumped on the passing gluten-free bandwagon these days. Manufacturers have started labeling everything from GF pretzels to vegetables with the words “gluten-free.” For awhile now, though, there has been an ongoing movement to try to standardize and universalize a GF label &#8212; the same way we have all gotten used to seeing that little green “Organic” seal of approval on organic foods. In 2007, the FDA issued the “[Proposed Rule for Gluten-Free Labeling][1],” opened the topic to discussion, but never implemented it. On August 3, 2011, the FDA officially re-opened the issue to comment but that comment period closed October 3, 2011. Therefore, as of 2012, the FDA has still not implemented any regulation to establish a national guideline for labeling foods gluten-free.

However, three industrious groups have attempted to establish their own set of qualification criteria in order to give those needing to eat gluten-free some degree of confidence in the products they purchase and consume. Let’s talk about these guys here:

The Gluten Intolerance Group started the “[Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO)][2]” to certify GF products. Foods with the GFCO label have been verifiably measured to contain less than 10 parts per million (ppm) of gluten. To receive this annual certification, manufacturers’ facilities have to be inspected, ingredients need to be reviewed and the products must be tested (both off the manufacturing line and from end-user random store shelf testing). The certification is renewable annually.

The [Celiac Sprue Association][3] (CSA) certification requires a 5 ppm gluten level, 5 ppm less than the GFCO standard. They also require foods to be free of oats (while not gluten-y themselves, oats are easily and often subject to cross contamination). Like the GFCO, the CSA label requires facility inspections, ingredient reviews and product tests. It also, however, requires a review and test of the food packaging to be sure it, too, is gluten-free.

The [National Foundation for Celiac Awareness][4] (NFCA) certification tests foods to the 10 ppm level just like the GFCO. They require facility inspections, food testing and product reviews along with additional ongoing compliance requirements. The NFCA program is run in conjunction with [Quality Assurance International][5] (QAI), a name you might recognize as the major certifier of organic products in the US.

While the specific requirements may all vary a bit, the general overall goal of these three certifications is the same: provide some measure of guarantee that a food that is labeled gluten-free actually IS gluten-free! Important, right? We think so. That’s why we keep waiting for the FDA to implement a standard and, in the meantime, paying our thanks to these three groups who have TRIED to do it themselves! Thanks!!!!!
