We had aÂ great interview with the very lovely, Ms. Judy Walker today from The Times Picayune here in New Orleans. Asked what one recipe are we most proud of in our new book was a toughie!! But, we went with our delicious New Orleans Chicken and Sausage Gumbo. The fact we found a way to make a roux work with Gluten Free flours still surprises us! Try this recipe in the article and surprise everyone you know with how tasty Gluten Free can be! Perfect for a chilly Sunday, curled up watching Football. Yum! Check it out and try it for yourself.
