We really love this product because it’s made from simply brown rice. That’s it, no other junk in it. No sugar, no sodium, no MSG, no fat!, just brown rice. Also, we like that it’s a product made locally in our great state of Louisiana! It’s milled so finely that it’s very similar to the consistency of Chinese or Superfine Rice flour, rather than an actual “bread crumb.” The beauty of it being milled so finely is that it can go pretty much undetected in your recipes. Some brown rice flours can be a bit nutty, but this brand has a very neutral flavor. They do a number of great gluten-free products, which even include a tempura batter mix, so check them out for yourselves. Umm tempura, I think I know what our next product review might be!

You can use these bread crumbs like you would any other bread crumb &#8212; for stuffings, breading meats etc. We like to add some dried Italian herbs and a bit of Parmesan Cheese to the bread crumbs to make our Momma’s Italian Meatloaf. Another great tip is take any seafood you like (shrimp, calamari, firm white fish fillets or oysters), and marinate it in a bit of buttermilk. Add some corn meal and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the crumbs. Mix it all together and dredge your seafood in the tasty crumb mix before frying or oven baking.
