<span>One of our visitors, Paula, just told us about these awesome gift baskets the University of Chicago Celiac Center is giving out!  GF newbies, those diagnosed by biopsy within the past 12 months, can contact the Center to receive this basket of foods and GF resources.  Intended to help start the GF journey off a little easier, Paula told us it was &#8220;a relief&#8221; to receive this goody basket.  Thanks, Paula, for sharing this great info!  And thanks to the Celiac Center and the basket sponsors for providing such a helpful and tasty treat!!!  Please visit the link below to learn more&#8230;</span>
