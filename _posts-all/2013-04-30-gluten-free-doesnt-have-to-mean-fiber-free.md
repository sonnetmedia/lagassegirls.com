We&#8217;ve heard from a few fellow GF&#8217;ers that they don&#8217;t think they are getting enough fiber in their diet since they started eating gluten free.  Admittedly, there are certainly no more Fiber Once bars being consumed but that doesn&#8217;t mean fiber isn&#8217;t found naturally in a whole host of other gluten free friendly foods.  Here, National Geographic posted a list of 5 types of fiber-rich foods that are all naturally gluten free.  So, if you&#8217;re concerned about fiber in your diet or know someone who is, please refer them to this short but informative article!
