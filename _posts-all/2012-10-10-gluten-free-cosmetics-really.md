You betcha!!!  While the science is still scant, more and more gluten-sensitive folks are opting for GF cosmetics and toiletries. They say that the GF versions help them feel better!!! We&#8217;ve included a link to a US News and World Report article from September 11, 2012 which discusses this topic at length.  It&#8217;s really interesting and probably not something lots of gluten sensitive people have considered&#8212;Jessie hadn&#8217;t after all these years!  But she might explore the GF options a bit after reading this!!!
