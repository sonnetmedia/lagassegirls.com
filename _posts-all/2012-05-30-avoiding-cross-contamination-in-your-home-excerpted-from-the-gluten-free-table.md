So, you’re wondering how to keep the foods needed for your gluten-free family member separate from those of the rest of the gluten-filled household? Let’s talk cross-contamination, then, shall we? Cross-contamination occurs when gluten comes in contact with gluten-free foods or products and, in turn, “contaminates” them. This can happen in several ways, unfortunately. Every shared surface, be it a toaster or even a butter knife, runs the risk of cross-contamination. Here is a list of some you may or may not be aware of:

*Shared Oil in Deep Fryers or Frying Pans*  
Hooray! Gluten-free individuals are still able to eat (most) French fries as well as some brands of gluten-free chicken nuggets and breaded fish products. However, if the fryer and/or oil in which the gluten-free versions are cooked is also the same fryer and/or oil being used to cook traditional glutinous foods, cross-contamination is possible. Ideally, there should be a separate fryer for gluten and gluten-free foods.

*BBQ Grills*  
Another sneaky one to watch out for, the home barbecue grill can contaminate even the best gluten-free food. If meats marinated in a gluten-laden sauce have been grilled on the same surface as a gluten-free meat, cross-contamination can occur. Make sure the grill is properly cleaned of all other products before cooking any gluten-free items.

*Toasters and Toaster Ovens*  
Again, if toasters are shared with nongluten-free products, cross-contamination is possible. It may not be ideal to have two separate toasters or toaster ovens, so we recommend getting a four-slice toaster and divvying up sides to the gluten-frees and the regulars. This will minimize contamination without requiring a second kitchen just for your kids’ toast!

*Cutting Boards*  
It’s very important to wash cutting boards very well in hot, soapy water if they are shared by gluten and gluten-free foods. As silly as it seems, we highly recommend having two separate cutting boards in the kitchen dedicated to gluten-free and non-gluten-free food preparation.

*Utensils, Cutlery, Pots, and Pans*  
All have to be washed thoroughly if shared to avoid cross contamination. Also, do not share a pot of boiling water to cook both gluten-free pasta and traditional. If sharing the pot can’t be avoided, cook the gluten-free version first to avoid contaminating it as much as possible.

*Shared Condiments*  
Shared butter or margarine, spreads, cream cheese, jars of jams or jellies, jars of peanut butters, almond butters, mayonnaise, and mustards can all become easily cross contaminated if shared when preparing food. If you want to have only one jar of each of these items, we recommend instituting a “clean spoon” rule. Always use a clean spoon to scoop out your condiment. Put it into a separate small bowl and use that bowl from which to spread it. This way, the gluten-covered butter knife never goes into the mayonnaise or jelly jar.

*Baking Equipment*  
Flour sifters, measuring scales, measuring cups, electric beaters, mixers, baking trays, and any other baking accoutrement should be thoroughly cleaned in hot, soapy water if they are shared with gluten-laden baking processes.

*Colanders*  
When draining pasta, using the same colander for gluten and gluten-free pastas runs a high risk of cross-contamination because real wheat pasta can get stuck in the holes of the colander and contaminate your lovely gluten-free version. Again, if you can, invest in two separate colanders at home. As tricky as it is to get a colander really, really clean (you know what we mean), we think having two is worth it!

*Dried Peas, Lentils, and Beans*  
Especially if buying from bulk bins, some pesky gluten-laden grains can easily get mixed up with the other products. We prefer to buy separate bags of these ingredients just to be safe. Either way, always make sure to sift and sort through your purchased product and pick out anything that looks suspicious. This is not a 100 percent fail-safe method, but it’s better than nothing!

Don’t be too hard on yourself, okay? It is virtually impossible to have a perfectly safe home kitchen environment if you are preparing both gluten-full and gluten-free foods. You are realistically going to have to do the best you can. However, these aforementioned list of tips can make a big difference, and we strongly advocate your implementing some or all of them if you can. Your villi will thank you!
