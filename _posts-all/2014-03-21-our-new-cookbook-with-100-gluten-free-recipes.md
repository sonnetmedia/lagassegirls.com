With a father famous for his bold Creole cuisine, we grew up loving rich foods full of big flavor. After learning we both had to eliminate wheat from our diets, we made it our mission to demonstrate that “gluten-free” doesn’t have to mean “flavor-free.” In our second cookbook, we offer classic recipes and family favorites made without gluten—and without sacrificing any of the signature tastes that make them so enticing.

Here are just a few of the big tasty recipes you’ll find in our new book:

**Spicy Crab Dip with Homemade Garlic Parmesan Crackers**  
**Crispy Sriracha and Lime Chicken Wings**  
**Warm Apple and Brie Tartlets**  
**Ooey Gooey Cinnamon Rolls**  
**Oatmeal Banana Pancakes with Caramelized Apple Syrup**  
**Kief Family Breakfast Casserole**  
**Toad in the Hole with Bacon Wrapped Asparagus Spears**  
**Spicy Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese Dippers**  
**Indian Chicken Salad Sandwiches on Homemade Socca Bread**  
**Baked “Fried” Shrimp Tacos with Mango Salsa and Homemade Zingy Tartar Sauce**  
**Gramma Hilda’s Traditional Portuguese Stuffing**  
**Home-style Chili with Gluten Free Beer**  
**E.J.’s Crunchy Fried Chicken**  
**Chicken and Dumplings**  
**Meme’s Eggplant and Ricotta Lasagna**
