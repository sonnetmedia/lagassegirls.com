Ho Ho Ho, only 4 more days to go and if you&#8217;re anything like our family, you&#8217;ll be busy as can be baking cookies till you can&#8217;t see straight! So many different types, so little time. We recently perfected one of our childhood favorites, the Oatmeal Raisin Cookie. Try making these to leave out for Santa this year and surprise him with a little Gluten Free childhood fav.

Now, if you have Celiac Disease, you probably aren&#8217;t sure if you can or can not tolerate oats. Oats are for the most part safe however the way oats are produced and processed here in America is usually what makes them &#8220;un-safe&#8221; for the GF&#8217;ers. It&#8217;s a cross contamination issue more than anything.

Now that there are so many different brands of Certified Gluten Free Oat out there, you should give them another chance and see how you feel. Oats are wonderful for you, try a steaming hot bowl with some coconut milk and fruit to set you up for the entire day with energy to spare. Or you could just eat a cookie or two. Perhaps not the same health benefits but hey, it&#8217;s the holidays!!

We wish you all the Happiest of Holidays and A Very Healthy New Year. Thank you for all your support thus far and we look forward to bigger and better things in 2013 for the Celiac Community. Go Team Gluten Free!!

Happy Holidays from us,

Jessie & Jilly

INGREDIENTS:

&#8211;  1 3/4 cup gluten free flour blend ( we&#8217;ve used Arrowhead Mills GF All Purpose Baking Mix)

&#8211;  1 tsp. baking soda

&#8211;  1 tsp. baking powder

&#8211;  1/2 tsp. cinammon

&#8211;  1/2 tsp. nutmeg

&#8211;  1/2 tsp. salt

&#8211;  2 sticks unsalted butter, softened to room temp.  ( equals 1 cup )

&#8211;  1/2 cup sugar

&#8211;  1 1/4 cup light brown sugar

&#8211;  2 eggs

&#8211;  2 tsp. vanilla extract

&#8211;  3 1/2 cups old fashioned certified glutenfree oats ( we&#8217;ve used Bob&#8217;s Red Mill )

&#8211;  1 1/2 cups raisins

you&#8217;ll also need some vegetable oil spray, a hand mixer/electric beaters and baking sheet pans.

&nbsp;

STEPS:

&nbsp;

1.) Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

2.) In a large bowl cream the butter, sugars, eggs and vanilla together using a hand mixer.

3.) In another bowl sift the glutenfree flour blend, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt together.

4.) Add the dry ingredients into the bowl of the wet ingredients and mix all together well with either the hand mixer or just a wooden spoon.

5.) Stir in the oats and raisins and with a wooden spoon mix all together well.

6.) Spray the baking sheet pans with a bit of vegetable oil spray.

7.) Spoon cookies onto the sheet pans as large or small as preferred and bake for 9-12 minutes. They should be cooked through but be careful to not over cook. Just a nice golden brown on the bottoms is what you want.

8.) Transfer cookies to a bakers rack to cool and serve.

This recipe makes roughly 30-32 medium sized cookies.
