It&#8217;s Super Bowl and that means lots of food, especially chicken wangs!!  These tasty little babies are a cinch to prepare, which makes them perfect for your big game day party! We have found these work better using “wingettes” or the smaller version of a chicken drumstick. If you can’t find them at your local grocery store, try and use the smallest drumstick you can find. These work equally well cooked on an outdoor grill or baked in the oven. The choice is yours.  These are one of Jessie’s sons, Jude’s, favorite party snacks. Sticky and sweet, tangy and tasty, these little drumsticks will be sure to please.

8 Small Chicken Drumsticks or Wingettes

2 tbsp. gluten free soy sauce or Tamari

2 tbsp. honey

<span style="text-decoration: underline">STEPS</span>

  1. With a sharp knife, score each drumstick or wingette three times to allow marinade to penetrate and place in a medium bowl.
  2. In a small bowl combine all the remaining ingredients, except the green onions and mix well.
  3. Pour this mixture over the chicken making sure the drumsticks are evenly coated.
  4. Cover with a bit of cling film and place in fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes, but no longer than 24 hours.
  5. Before cooking or grilling, allow chicken to come to room temperature to ensure the meat is tender and juicy, not tough and chewy.
  6. Pre-heat oven to 375 Degrees Fahrenheit.
  7. Spray a baking tray with a non-stick olive oil spray.
  8. Place drumsticks on prepared baking tray and cook for 30 – 35 minutes depending on size, till cooked fully through. Turn once during cooking.
  9. Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with a bit of sliced green onions.
