Oh how we have desperately missed the texture of French bread!  Until recently, no GF manufacturer has come close to the correct consistency and taste&#8230;but enter &#8220;Against the Grain.&#8221;  This Vermont-based bread maker has tried&#8212;and succeeded (in our opinion)&#8212;to replicate the classic, artisan baguette in a GF version.  Using only a few, simple ingredients including tapioca starch, milk, eggs and cheese, they have created a loaf which is light and airy on the inside but crunchy on the outside.  YUM!  We&#8217;ve used these for croutons, sandwiches, crostini, stuffing, anything a great tasking baguette would be suited for, really.  We find ours locally at Whole Foods but their website has a fantastic little &#8220;Store Locator&#8221; feature so you can find a place selling them near you!  Try them out and let us know what you use them for!!!
