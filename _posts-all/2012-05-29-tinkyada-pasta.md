This is Jill’s absolute go-to for gluten free pasta. Be it the lasagna sheets, penne or the lil’ shells that Jessie likes to make her kid-friendly mac n’ cheese with, you just can’t beat it. This brown rice pasta cooks perfectly and never ends up in the usual mushy mass. Because it is made from brown rice, it’s very healthy for you, has a low Glycemic index and is easily digested by even the most sensitive of tummys. Try for yourselves the next time you’re thinking of cooking up your favorite pasta dish.

We recommend adding a bit of olive oil to boiling water before adding pasta to the pan. This will ensure that the pasta won’t stick together. Try using this pasta with our fabulous Baked Mac N’ Cheese recipe in *The Gluten-Free Table*. Yum!
