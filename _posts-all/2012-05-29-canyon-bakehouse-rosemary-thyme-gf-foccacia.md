This has to be one of our top favorite new finds from this incredible, 100% dedicated gluten-free bakehouse. We, like most others with a wheat intolerance, thought our days of dipping warm focaccia bread into olive oil and balsamic vinegar were just food memories of our past. All until we discovered this. Itâ€™s simply superb. We will guarantee that anyone who tastes this bread will agree, celiac or not!

This foccacia is perfectly delicious on its own, perhaps with a glass of red wine and dipped in your favorite olive oil. But, we like to add a few of our favorite toppings, bake and serve cut into mini pizza bites. Try topping with some beautiful olives, a bit of goats cheese and caramelized onions, bake as directed, cut into small squares and serve at your next get together. Scrumptious.
