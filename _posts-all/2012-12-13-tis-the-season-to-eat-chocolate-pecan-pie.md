title: Tis The Season to eat Chocolate Pecan Pie!!
author: jilly
excerpt: "It's that time of year again where we bake (and eat!) more pies than we can count and when our need for elasticated waist banded pants seems to be needed more and more. Ahhh, thank you Mr. Leggings! Well, we have always loved this time of year because it meant all of our family gathering in one kitchen and everyone making his or her favorite or requested treats. And down here in N'awlins....it ain't Christmas without a big ol' slice of Pecan Pie. This is our twist on the classic by adding a few chocolate chips to make an even MORE decadent dessert....if that's possible?! "

It&#8217;s that time of year again where we bake (and eat!) more pies than we can count and when our need for elasticated waist banded pants seems to be needed more and more. Ahhh, thank you Mr. Leggings! Well, we have always loved this time of year because it meant all of our family gathering in one kitchen and everyone making his or her favorite or requested treats. And down here in N&#8217;awlins&#8230;.it ain&#8217;t Christmas without a big ol&#8217; slice of Pecan Pie. This is our twist on the classic by adding a few chocolate chips to make an even MORE decadent dessert&#8230;.if that&#8217;s possible?!

This was one of our Grand-daddy&#8217;s most favorite things for us to make, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a proper holiday season without making it! And trust us, even the folks who claim to not like pecans&#8230;.seem to always be a convert after one bite of this pie.

We&#8217;ve recently discovered the BEST thing that we&#8217;ve seen to happen to the GF world in ages at our local Whole Foods&#8230;&#8230;Pre-made Gluten Free Pie Shells?!!? What??? Can it be??? Dreams really DO come true. Well, we bought a load of those babies and have been baking pies all week! You name it, we&#8217;re trying it! They&#8217;re actually very good. So, if you can, go down to your local Whole Foods and you can find them in the Gluten Free Frozen section. Have a play with them and send us your pics or recipes!!

If you don&#8217;t have a local Whole Foods near by, we&#8217;ll also put up our recipe for our Gluten Free pastry from our book. A little bit more work than just buying the pre-made variety but, you&#8217;ll need it to burn off all that pie!!

Wishing you the very happiest and healthiest of holidays, Jilly & Jessie
