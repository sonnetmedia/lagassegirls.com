Lots of non-gluten-sensitive individuals are trying a GF diet these days because they say it helps them feel better overall&#8212;despite not having a medical condition requiring them to eat GF.  Some people are even saying a GF diet will help you lose weight.  In our personal experience, switching to a GF diet did help us feel better but it did NOTHING flattering for our figures!  It&#8217;s important to remember GF doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean low in calories.  If you are trying to lose weight, go ahead and give GF a try but still keep an eye on your calorie intake&#8230;because you might be surprised just how high in calories some GF foods can be.

Related to this topic, we&#8217;ve included a link to the Daily Mail, a British post, discussing the GF diet and its relation to weight loss for some celebrities.  Have a read for yourself and let us know what you think.
