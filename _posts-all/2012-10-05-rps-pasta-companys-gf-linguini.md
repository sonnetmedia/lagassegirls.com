So, we are new at adding the pictures!  But don&#8217;t let that slight technological learning curve take away from this delicious GF linguini the RP&#8217;s Pasta Company has produced!  It is a very close approximation in texture and taste to regular gluteny fresh pasta, it&#8217;s not mushy and it holds up well in both sauce and a simple parmesan cheese/garlic/olive oil bath too.  Even Jessie&#8217;s boys enjoyed it&#8212;and they are big carbohydrate connoisseurs so that says a lot!  RP&#8217;s has created a whole line of these &#8220;fresh&#8221; GF pasta products.  You can check them out for yourself at <http://www.rpspasta.com>.  Yum!
