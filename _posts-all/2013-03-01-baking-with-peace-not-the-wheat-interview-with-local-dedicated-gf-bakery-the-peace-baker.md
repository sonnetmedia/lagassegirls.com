If you have ever been to New Orleans for a Mardi Gras&#8230;.or even heard about what all this Mardi Gras fuss is, you would most certainly know that for many it is the time of year to celebrate. Not just beads, parades and Bourbon Street&#8230;.oh no, to most locals Mardi Gras equals the one and only KING CAKE!!! King Cake is just as much apart of the Mardi Gras tradition as anything and it is what as young girls we were most excited about when carnival season would be upon us. King cake is a deliciously rich Danish dough that is braided,  baked, and then topped with a covering of a sticky sugar syrup in the traditional Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold. A little plastic baby is also inserted into the cake and tradition goes, whomever finds the lil baby has to buy the King Cake next year!! As children we remember this was our equivalent to Charlie finding the Golden Ticket for the chocolate factory!

As you can imagine&#8230;.a rich Danish dough is most certainly NOT in our Gluten Free diets, so for many years we&#8217;d just have to pass on this delicious tradition&#8230;.usually shed a few tears and hope that just someday some amazing person would be able to create a Gluten Free version.

Well, the time has come people!! The incredibly talented owner and creator of The Peace Baker here in New Orleans, Louisiana has done just that. Ms. Kelly Boffone, we salute you and your allergy friendly delisiousness. You truly have cracked the code for amazing Gluten Free treats! Ms. Kelly was kind enough to take a bit of time out of her manic Mardi Gras/King Cake making schedule to answer a few or our questions. All we can say is, if you live locally and haven&#8217;t tried The Peace Baker and all Ms. Kelly&#8217;s handywork&#8230;..GO. IMMEDIATELY!! If you don&#8217;t live locally&#8230;book a flight! She is doing some wonderful things not only for our fabulous New Orleans community, but for the Gluten Free community as well.

For we Lagasse Girls to have found The Peace Baker&#8230;..well, all we can say is it feels like we found the baby in a King Cake for sure!

The Peace Baker is located at 6601 Veterans Blvd. Suite 1, Metarie, LA 70003

**INTERVIEW: **

**Lagasse Girls: How did The Peace Baker start and what made you want to open here in New Orleans?**

***Peace Baker:*** &#8220;I always LOVED baking. When I was little I would spend all of my time in my mom’s kitchen making  
creations. Once I graduated from high school, I began working as a pastry artist at Maurice’s in  
Fat City. It was then that I realized I wanted to be a pastry chef. I went to Nicholl’s and studied  
under Chef John Folse. After receiving my B.A., I moved to Minnesota and taught pastry at Le  
Cordon Bleu. After 6 years of living up there, I missed New Olreans terribly and moved back and  
took a position at Emeril’s (yes, I worked for your dad!) as Executive Pastry Chef. I still felt as  
though something was missing, and I was not content. You see, I have a dairy intolerance and  
while I enjoyed baking, I was never able to fully enjoy the things I was making. It was then that  
I decided that I want to open an allergy friendly bakery. I LOVE New Orleans, and I wanted to  
share my God-given talent with my community.&#8221;

**LG: Did you feel there was a need here for such a specialty bakery locally?**

***PB:* &#8220;**Yes! While some bakeries in the area offer allergy friendly items, they do not have a varied selection of goods, or  
you have to place an order in advance. We are the first Dedicated Gluten Free Bakery in New  
Orleans!&#8221;

**LG: When did you open your doors, any reason you chose the area you did?**

***PB:** &#8220;*This is a funny story! My plan was that prior to officialy, opening I wanted to test my new ovens and “practice” in  
my kitchen. We literally had people knocking on the doors all day long, begging for some of my  
sweet treats! I realized then that it was time to open my doors and serve my community. We  
had a soft opening that began the week of Father’s Day, 2012. Our official Grand Opening was  
held in August. As far as location goes….I wanted a place that received a lot of traffic (I-10), that  
was centrally located to all of Metro New Orleans, and that made the most sense cost wise.  
What has the response been since opening…has it been received well? It has been amazing! I  
feel the New Orleans community has truly embraced us.&#8221;

**LG: What do you envision for your future…where would you like this whole thing to go?**  
***PB: &#8220;*** I see The Peace Baker expanding. I plan to open at least one satellite location in the near future. I would  
also like to offer gluten free cooking classes. We are also in the process of becoming Kosher  
certified.&#8221;

**LG: You sent us your incredible Gluten Free King Cake and it truly is incredible! How in the world did**  
**you crack that?**

***PB:*** &#8220;I had many sleepless nights playing in my kitchen! One of the first questions we  
received when opening was, “Will you be making king cakes?” I then made it my goal to provide  
my customers with one of their favorite New Orleans treats.&#8221;

**LG: Are there any other desserts in particular that you “cracked” to make Gluten Free that even**  
**surprised you it was possible?**

***PB:&#8221;** *Eclairs and my light and fluffy biscuits!&#8221;

&nbsp;

**LG:** Please tell our readers how long your fab king cakes will be available and how to purchase if  
they don’t live locally in this amazing city of ours.  
***PB:***  &#8220;We will be making king cakes year round!  
They are now a staple product in our case. We will have traditional Mardi Gras colored king  
cakes, and decorate other’s festive to the current holiday (i.e., Valentine’s, St. Patty’s Day).&#8221;  
For pick up, delivery and shipping, you will need to place an order for a king cake by calling the  
store, 504-888-9094, or via email: thepeacebaker@yahoo.com
