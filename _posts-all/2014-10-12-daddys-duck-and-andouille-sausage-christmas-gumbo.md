** Ingredients:**

1 1/2 to 2 pounds domestic duck breasts

1 1/2 teaspoons Emeril’s Original Essence seasoning or Cajun seasoning of your choice

1 cup vegetable oil

1 1/3 cups gluten-free flour blend (we like Arrowhead Mills Gluten Free

All Purpose Baking Mix)

1 1/2 cups finely chopped yellow onion

3/4 cup finely chopped green bell pepper

3/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper

1 cup finely chopped celery

1 teaspoon minced garlic

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste

1/4 teaspoon salt

Freshly ground black pepper

1 pound gluten-free andouille sausage or smoked sausage, halved

lengthwise and cut into bite-size slices (we like Wellshire Farms

andouille)

1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

2 bay leaves

10 cups chicken or vegetable stock

1/3 cup finely sliced green onions, plus more for garnish

2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley, plus more for garnish

1 1/2 to 2 cups cooked wild rice

&nbsp;

** Steps:  **

  1. Using a sharp knife, in a crisscross fashion, slice the fatty skin on the duck

breasts to score the meat, being mindful not to fully cut through the breasts. Season

all sides of the duck breasts with the Essence.

&nbsp;

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    In either a large Dutch oven or a 6- to 8-quart heavy stockpot, heat the oil over
  </li>
</ol>

medium-high heat. Once the pan is piping hot, add the seasoned duck breasts,

scored-skin-side down first, and cook for 6 to 7 minutes, or until the skin becomes

nice and crispy.

&nbsp;

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Once the skin is crispy, gently flip the duck breasts and cook for another
  </li>
</ol>

5 minutes. Remove the breasts from the oil and place on a large plate or baking

sheet, loosely cover with foil, and set aside.

&nbsp;

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Add the gluten-free flour mix to the same pot over medium heat to make a
  </li>
</ol>

roux. Stir constantly and cook for 20 minutes.

&nbsp;

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    After 20 minutes, add the onions, bell peppers, celery, garlic, cayenne, salt,
  </li>
</ol>

and pepper to taste. Cook until the vegetables soften, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring

constantly.

&nbsp;

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    Next, add the andouille sausage and fresh thyme to the pot, stir, and cook for
  </li>
</ol>

5 minutes.

&nbsp;

<ol start="7">
  <li>
    Add the bay leaves and stock, turn the heat up to medium high, and bring to
  </li>
</ol>

a gentle boil.

&nbsp;

<ol start="8">
  <li>
    Once boiling gently, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 1 hour, uncovered,
  </li>
</ol>

stirring frequently.

&nbsp;

<ol start="9">
  <li>
    After the hour, add the whole duck breasts into the pot and simmer on low
  </li>
</ol>

for another hour, stirring frequently.

&nbsp;

10.  After this hour, use a slotted spoon to remove the bay leaves and discard

them. Also, if any fat/oil has risen to the top, skim it off and discard it now as well.

&nbsp;

11.  Using tongs or a fork, gently remove the whole duck breasts from the pot

and place on a cutting board. If there are any large, loose pieces of duck fat, remove

and discard them. The meat should be very tender. Either chop the breasts into

bite-size chunks, or, as we prefer, let the breasts cool slightly until you can handle

them and shred the breasts with your hands. Wearing disposable plastic gloves is

helpful here.

&nbsp;

12.  Once your duck meat is chopped or shredded, add the meat back to the pan,

along with the green onions and parsley. Stir and taste for seasoning. If you’d like

to add a bit more cayenne, salt, or pepper, do so now. Cook for a final 30 minutes,

stirring frequently.

&nbsp;

13.  Serve the gumbo over the cooked wild rice in deep bowls, garnishing with a

bit more green onion or parsley, if desired. Serve immediately.
