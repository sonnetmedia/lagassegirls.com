I bet you thought your days of eating a delicious, pre-made, authentic Ravioli were long gone once you knew you couldn&#8217;t eat Gluten or Wheat products anymore. Well, you&#8217;re about to be deliciously proven wrong. We&#8217;ve recently discovered a line of incredible Gluten Free/Wheat Free Products by a company called Conte&#8217;s Pasta. They come in 2 flavors; Cheese or Spinach & Cheese and they are both divine. Like little cheese-filled pillows of heaven&#8230;YUM!!Â  We couldn&#8217;t believe they tasted as good as they did and they cook in only 6 minutes! They&#8217;ve inspired us to make all kind of yummy pasta sauces to compliment these perfect lil&#8217; treasures. Try them today and we assure you your whole family will enjoy. They also do amazing Gluten Free Wheat Free Pirogi and a few pizzas too. Try them and let US know how they taste please.
