HOT MAMA’S SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP

8 – 10 appetizer sized servings

&nbsp;

Please tell us who doesn’t like a little spinach and artichoke dip? Seriously, show yourselves! Whenever we are both home in New Orleans we always try to go to one of our favorite restaurants, Houston’s. They make the most amazing spinach and artichoke dip, among many other things. It wasn’t until recently that we found out that their version is prepared using a béchamel sauce using wheat flour. NOOO!! Cue our mission to make a hot little mama version of this dip, our way, deliciously full of flavor and completely gluten free. We used fontina cheese as opposed to the usual mozzerella. The nuttiness of the cheese adds a nice dimension we think. Serve with vegetable crudités or your favorite tortilla corn chip and Jilly’s personal favorite, a cold margarita. This tasty party dip won’t last long. Now all we need is the party!
