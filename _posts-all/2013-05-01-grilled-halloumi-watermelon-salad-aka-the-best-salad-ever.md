Hello, my name is Jilly and I am a Halloumi-aholic. For those of you who may be living in some sort of cheese coma and who aren&#8217;t aware of what Halloumi even is, let alone had the delicious pleasure of trying it&#8230;.get ready to form a line and THANK ME!! Quite simply, it&#8217;s yummy, salty, hot cheese heaven. Halloumi is a delicious Cypriot cheese usually made from goat or sheep’s milk. Also known as the squeaky cheese, Halloumi is quite salty in flavor, which is perfect with the watermelon and mint. It also has a very high melting point, making it perfect for barbequing, grilling or frying. Because of this unique quality, there isn’t really a substitute for Halloumi, although you could use Feta cheese, un-grilled, for another take. It will still make for a great salad, though perhaps not as stand out as the original. You can find this delight in most grocery stores in the specialty cheese section. Make the effort to find it and try this dish at your next Barbeque. Let us know what you think. Here&#8217;s to you Mr. Halloumi

GRILLED HALLOUMI AND WATERMELON SALAD

Serves 2 &#8211; 4

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">INGREDIENTS</span>

½ of a small red onion, finely sliced

juice of 1 lime

2 cups watermelon, seedless and cut into bite size chunks

1/3 cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped

2 ½ Ounces (roughly 4 cups) Arugula or rocket salad leaves

8 Ounce block of Halloumi cheese, cut into ¼ “ slices

1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil

&nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline">STEPS</span>

  1. In a small bowl combine the red onion and limejuice and let stand for 15 minutes. This lets the acid in the citrus juice sweeten the onion naturally.
  2. On a large plate or serving platter, arrange the arugula leaves evenly to create a base for the dish.
  3. Heat either your griddle or sauté pan on medium heat. Once hot, grill or fry the cheese for 4 – 5 minutes, or until golden in color, on each side. Turn off heat and set aside.
  4. Drain any liquid from the red onions.
  5. Arrange the watermelon, red onions and grilled Halloumi on top of greens.
  6. Sprinkle the mint over top and drizzle with the olive oil on top of all to finish. Serve immediately.
