Mmmmmm!  Doughnuts were a weekend tradition for us when growing up so you can imagine they are something we missed once we had to go gluten free.  These Kinnikinnick vanilla cake doughnuts are pretty tasty and come in a box of 6.  The dough is close in consistency to the gluten-filled version and the icing is very sweet and vanilla-y.  Our only constructive criticism is that they come out of the microwave really hot so you have to wait a bit before eating them!!!
