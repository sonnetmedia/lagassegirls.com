Lots has been said arguing both for and against the benefits of using a gluten free/casein free diet to treat children with autism.  There are stories reporting great positive changes in some autistic children&#8217;s behavior once put on a GFCF diet.  And yet there are many stories reporting no positive effect.  Who&#8217;s to know?  It seems concrete scientific studies are still lacking so, for now, it is at the discretion of parents, caregivers and physicians whether this diet helps or not.  We have personally spoken with many parents for whom this diet produced wonderfully positive results in their children and we think it is definately an area of research worth watching.  WebMD had this nice, unbiased summary of the issue (<http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/gluten-free-casein-free-diets-for-autism>) so we thought we&#8217;d share it with all of you.  It&#8217;s an intriguing theory that we are following closely and we hope you find it interesting too.  Please share your thoughts and experiences with the GFCF diet if you can!
