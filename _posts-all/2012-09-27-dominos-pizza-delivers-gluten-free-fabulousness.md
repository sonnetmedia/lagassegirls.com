You may or may not have heard the word through the Gluten Free grape vine&#8230;.Domino&#8217;s, yes THE Domino&#8217;s Pizza that you probably still dream of eating from before you were diagnosed with a gluten or wheat intolerance, is now offering a gluten free pizza crust!! Now, be advised they do warn that there are concerns of cross contamination since the pizzas are not made in a 100% dedicated gluten free facility. Therefore, they don&#8217;t recommend ordering and eating the pizza if you have a severe allergy or Celiac Disease.

But, we like a challenge and seeing as Jilly has the stronger intolerance, who better than to be the Domino&#8217;s pizza eating guinea pig and to honestly report back to you all?!

We both indulged, Jessie tried a cheese and sausage version while Jilly with her newly &#8220;dairy free zone&#8221; body decided to go with every veggie they could pile on and a bit of Italian Sausage too. YUM!!

It was delicious!! The taste brought back memories of being kids and our usual Friday night routine of delivery pizza being eaten with all of our many cousins, arguing over who&#8217;s movie choice it was for the week.

The crust was very enjoyable, far from some of the cardboard versions we&#8217;ve tested over the years. It was crisp yet light and held together exceptionally well compared to some that fall a bit flimsy and give way. It held up well and was delightfully topped with all the yumminess we chose.

The best part is&#8230;.it was hot, fresh and delivered to our door?? Something we haven&#8217;t had the luxury of enjoying in YEARS!!

What&#8217;s great is that you can order it just as you would any pizza, choosing your sauce, cheese and topping preferences.

So, this makes a great option if not all of your household or family is Gluten Free as you can all enjoy in something together that you probably haven&#8217;t gotten to do in a while&#8230;..all order a pizza, argue over which movie to watch as a family and enjoy your very own Friday Night Pizza Party.

Health and tummy wise&#8230;..I must admit, we were both FINE after!! No incidents to mention, which is always good. Obviously everyone is different, but we really do recommend you give it a try once at least.

Try it today and let us know what you think.

Enjoy!!
