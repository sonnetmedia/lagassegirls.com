Kind Healthy Grains’ mission statement is “ingredients you can see and pronounce.” But my most favorite thing to do with their products is to taste! Finally, nutritious, safe gluten free granola clusters that are actually delicious. These babies are packed full of whole grains like certified gluten free oats, buckwheat, millet, amaranth and quinoa. All of that equals high fiber and a low GI (glycemic index) which means a healthy, happy digestive system. These can even control your appetite all while tasting great. Yes please!

Try this mixed in with non-fat Greek yogurt and dried cherries. Or for a fabulously easy dessert option, use as a crumble topping on your next warm gluten free peach, apple or rhubarb crumble. Top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and dig in. Hurray for this delicious gluten free granola!!
