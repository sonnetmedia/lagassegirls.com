If you are like us, pizza is one of the typically gluteny foods we crave all the time.  There are lots of options on the market these days but Udi’s has produced a tasty version of the classic Margherita thin crust that is worth a try.  The sauce is tangy and compliments the traditional mozzarella and basil toppings quite well.  In our taste test, the edge of the crust cooked to a crispy bite while the center remained softer and almost chewy.  Like many other GF products, this pizza is best when eaten warm or hot so heat one up and enjoy it right out of the oven or off the grill!
