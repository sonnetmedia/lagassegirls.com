The other day, I had a sudden craving for&#8230;yup, you guessed it, oatmeal raisin cookies.  I couldn&#8217;t make them from scratch, though, as I had two little ones home sick and no way to get dough mixed and baked without some catastrophe occuring!  Luckily, I had been given this box of Udi&#8217;s Oatmeal Raisin Cookies at the Celiac Disease Foundation&#8217;s GF Expo last weekend.  WOW!  They are soft, chewy and flavored just like my homemade ones.  Plus, they are bite-sized&#8230;well, two-bite-sized if I&#8217;m being honest.  DELICIOUS!  So good, in fact, that I was only able to save two from the ravenous cookie-eaters that live at my house.  Even those have since been eaten&#8212;so I apologize for the somewhat blurry photo below but I didn&#8217;t have any cookies left to try again!  Please email us or comment with your opinions AND if you&#8217;ve tried any other really tasty GF cookie.  I LOVE cookies and will happily sample anything anyone recommends!
