We both know, from personal experience, that getting a celiac disease diagnosis or a gluten sensitivity diagnosis can be a LIFE changer! We went from feeling lethargic, queesy and unhealthy every day to feeling healthy, energized and optimistic&#8212;all because we FINALLY knew what was wrong with us AND what we needed to do to feel better! This little article is intended to give you a brief overview of the typical diagnosis procedures used in identifying celiac disease.

Typically, celiac disease is identified through a blood test, intestinal biopsy or both. The blood test is, by far, the simplest procedure and can be done wherever blood work is performed. In the blood test, three specific types of antibodies are isolated: endomysial antibodies, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-gliadin antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that a person’s immune system usually produces to fight infections. In a person with celiac disease, the body is producing the above mentioned antibodies to fight off NON-infectious substances i.e. the gluten in your food and your own tissues. According to WebMD, a person who has elevated levels of endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. The anti-gliadin antibody test seems, from the research we have seen, to be less accurate in making a definitive diagnosis but can be a still valuable indicator. Medical-speak aside, the bottom line is that you should request your doctor order the blood test for you if you have the symptoms of celiac disease or if any close familial relative has already been diagnosed with the disease.

While the blood test is a great non-invasive option, the intestinal biopsy is still currently considered to be the most accurate test for celiac disease out there. It’s typically used as a follow-up confirmation when the blood test indicates celiac but it can also be done without the preceding blood work. In this procedure, a physician inserts an endoscope down the patient’s esophagus and takes biopsies of the small intestine. These samples are then examined by a pathologist for signs of celiac disease including the damaged villi you may have heard about. The procedure is done while the patient is sedated so it is not painful and does not take very long to complete. Recovery is usually easy and fast.

IMPORTANT WORD OF WARNING: you HAVE to have been following a gluten-FILLED diet before these tests. If patients have been eating gluten-free, the absence of gluten will allow your intestines to start repairing themselves and your body to stop producing the marker antibodies. You can easily get a false negative result from either the blood test or the biopsy if you’ve been eating gluten-free. Just FYI!
