    One of Jessie’s favorite Sunday Fall meals is this Chili recipe.  It combines the expected ingredients with some unexpected additions like coffee and GF beer to create a seasoned, flavorful chili that’s just right.   Another plus is that it freezes quite well so if you can’t finish off the whole batch, you can save the leftovers for next week! Just a note of advice, this recipe tastes best with a lager-style beer, so look for that description when choosing a beer for this recipe.

  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a large saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat, cook the diced bacon until crisp. Drain, transfer the bacon to a bowl, and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the same pan, brown the ground beef. Once cooked, drain if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, in a large stockpot over medium heat, heat the olive oil. Saute the onions, celery, and bell peppers until soft, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another 1 to 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the cooked beef, the bacon, and all the remaining ingredients except the kidney beans. Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer the chili, uncovered, for 45 to 50 minutes. Stir the mixture often to ensure no pieces are sticking to the bottom and burning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Gently add the kidney beans and let cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      If too much liquid remains at the end of this cooking time for your preference, you can ladle some of it off the top. Just remember that the chili will thicken slightly and absorb some additional liquid as it cools.
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-season the chili if necessary and serve with your favorite chili accompaniments.
    </li>
  </ol>
