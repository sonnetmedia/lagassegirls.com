Just a quick shout out and super huge THANK YOU to everyone who helped make our appearance at Boudin and Beer a success! We were the only dessert being served at the event and we were THRILLED at the reception everyone gave our wonderful little mini GF key lime pies!  We served more than 1,400 mini-pies to both GF adherents and nonGF&#8217;ers alike.  Our most rewarding part of the night was hearing people say, &#8220;It&#8217;s so good, you&#8217;d never know it was gluten free!&#8221;  EXACTLY!  That&#8217;s our mission:  to prepare delicious GF foods that you&#8217;d never even know were GF because they taste oh-so good.  Thanks to all those who attended this valuable and beneficial event.  We hope to see everyone again next year!
