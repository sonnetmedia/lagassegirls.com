This is Jilly&#8217;s new fav find for a delicious and healthy alternative to milk. She&#8217;s recently discovered dairy products aren&#8217;t her friend so she has been trying em&#8217; all; soy milk, rice milk, almond milk&#8230;.even coconut milk! But this delicious milk is made from flax seeds so its jam packed with 1200 mg of Omega 3&#8217;s per serving and only 50 calories. Even though it&#8217;s free of lactose and dairy, gluten and soy, it still has as much calcium as dairy milk. Bonus! It&#8217;s low sodium and comes in 3 flavors to choose from; Unsweetened, Original and Vanilla. We like the Original flavor, but go on and give all 3 a go and see which one you dig.
