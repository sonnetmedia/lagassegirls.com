Have you just not felt “right” for awhile? Have a slew of traditional MD’s been unable to figure out what ails you? Maybe you have celiac disease? Below are a bunch of the most typical symptoms one could see with this disease. Remember, though, that not every body reacts the same and some people show no outward symptoms at all! Have a read and, if you think some of these symptoms describe what you are feeling or experiencing, please ask your doctor to test you for celiac. For more details on getting diagnosed, please see our “Getting Diagnosed” info.

Did you know there are over 300 possible symptoms of celiac disease? These can vary from mild to severe and they depend on the individual. The most common (and most unpleasant) symptoms are:

  1. Stomach issues: recurring abdominal bloating, cramping and pain, excessive gas, chronic diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, abnormal, pale or foul smelling stools.
  2. Weight loss or, in some cases, weight gain.
  3. Fatigue, weakness and inability to think clearly or focus.
  4. Any combination of iron, folic acid or Vitamin B12 deficiency.
  5. Arthritis, bone or joint pain, bone loss or osteoporosis
  6. Headaches or migraines
  7. Depression and anxiety
  8. Seizures
  9. In women: missed or irregular menstrual periods, infertility/ fertility problems and repeated miscarriages.
 10. Hair loss or alopecia
 11. Dermatitis Herpetiformis (DH), which is an itchy skin rash
 12. Mouth ulcers, tooth enamel problems
 13. Neurological problems like poor muscle coordination, tingling in hands or feet.

It’s important to remember people can have celiac disease and not show any symptoms. It can even lie dormant in your system for years. Sometimes the symptoms can be triggered by a traumatic or stressful event like a death, childbirth, a stressful move or even planning a wedding. Neither of us showed any symptoms until we were in our twenties. Other people we know didn’t develop symptoms until their forties and yet others have had the disease since childhood. Interesting, huh? Whether you are 10 or 85, it’s never too early or late to get tested for celiac. Just keep an eye on your symptoms and talk with your doctor if you think celiac might be an issue for you!
