So, yes, we know going &#8220;gluten free&#8221; has become somewhat of a &#8220;fad&#8221; and that folks with no dietary necessity are still choosing to eliminate or even reduce the amount of gluten in their diets.  Is this a good idea?  Does it even matter?  Well, the folks at Scientific American published an interesting article entitled &#8220;Most People Shouldn&#8217;t Eat Gluten Free&#8221; in which they make an argument for why going gluten free by choice may not be dietarily wise or even safe.  Check it out here at <http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=most-people-shouldnt-eat-gluten-free> and let us know your thoughts!
