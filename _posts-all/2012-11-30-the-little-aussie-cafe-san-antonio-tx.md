Carlene Wilson submitted this recommendation and review of **The Little Aussie Cafe and Bakery**.  It sounds terrific and we will definately try to get there if we are ever in San Antonio!  Below is what Carlene had to say about this neat little GF place:

&#8220;The greatest restaurant to me is a completely gluten free restaurant and I have found one here in San Antonio, Texas.  
The **Little Aussie Cafe** has so many things you can eat and not have to question.  
Their menu also shows when one of their meals has different allergens in them as well.  
Ah yes eating with confidence is something you can do here.  
They serve a lot of sandwiches and bread along with pies and a lot of other scrumptious items on the menu.  
It is also a bakery.  
VERY delicious!

If youre ever in town come check them out <img src="http://lagassegirls.dev/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  
They are a little pricey but well worth it.  
I go there because I am super sensitive to even cross contamination but there due to the fact that theres no gluten there, then theres no problem with that.&#8221;

Awesome info and thanks for all the detail, Carlene!  We appreciate your contribution!
