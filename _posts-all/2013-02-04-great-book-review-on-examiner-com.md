A lovely review of our book,  THE GLUTEN FREE TABLE ran on Examiner.com saying, “This cook book would make a great gift, or serve as a pleasant addition to your cook book library” along with a lot of other praise for our humble gluten free book that could!! It&#8217;s always so nice to hear people are liking the book and are enjoying the recipes as much as we do. Check out the fab review by Ms. Jennifer Harris on examiner.com today. One more high five for Team Gluten Free!! Woohoo <img src="http://lagassegirls.dev/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
