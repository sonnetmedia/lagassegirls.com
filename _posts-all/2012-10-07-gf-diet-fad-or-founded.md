We were browsing the Internet today and found this link to a CBS News report from 07/31/2012.  It&#8217;s an interesting article which discusses whether or not there has been an increase in Celiac Disease prevalence in the US over the last few decades and what could be to blame.  The statistics are quite significant (we think anyway) and it&#8217;s an interesting read.  Please check it out at:
