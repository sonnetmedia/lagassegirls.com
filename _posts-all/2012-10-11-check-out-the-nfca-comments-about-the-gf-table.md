Hey everyone!  If you saw any of our news interviews this week, you probably heard us mention the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness&#8217; website, [www.celiaccentral.org][1].  They have one of the best GF websites we&#8217;ve found and we really like what they&#8217;re doing!!!  This week, they posted a review of the book that we wanted to share with you.  Check it out at the following link:
