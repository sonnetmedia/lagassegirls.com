Our little sister, Meril, a.k.a. Mookie, LOVES cheese. While she really likes stinky cheese, we didn’t want to scare anyone away from this delicious recipe so we toned it down QUITE a bit! This recipe uses Havarti, Gruyère, and Cheddar to create a rich, tangy taste. And the best news of all is that this is a Quick and Easy recipe that takes 30 minutes or less to make. If you want to see David Venable enjoy Mookie’s Mac on QVC’s “In the Kitchen with David,” check out the video here: [*http://qvc.co/1mG7sPd. *][1] Or get this recipe and 99 more when you buy the book here:*  *

&nbsp;

1 pound gluten-free macaroni or shells

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

3 tablespoons gluten-free flour blend (we like Arrowhead Mills

Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Mix)

2 cups whole milk

8 ounces white Cheddar, shredded

6 ounces Havarti, sliced thin and broken into the smallest possible pieces

6 ounces Gruyère, shredded

Generous pinch of cayenne pepper

Salt and freshly ground black pepper

&nbsp;

Steps:

&nbsp;

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degree F.
  2. In a large stockpot, cook the pasta until al dente, about 8 to 12 minutes,depending on the pasta shape you’ve chosen. Drain, return it to the pot, and set aside.
  3. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, constantly stirring, to blend the butter and flour into a roux.
  4. Next, add the milk and whisk until the roux is dissolved into the milk. Whisking often, cook until the sauce thickens and begins to boil.
  5. Once the sauce has thickened up, remove the pan from the heat and stir in all three cheeses, along with the pinch of cayenne and salt and pepper to taste. As soon as all of the cheese is melted and the sauce is ooey-gooey cheesy thick, pour it over the pasta. Gently stir the mixture together until all of the cheese sauce is evenly distributed in the pasta.
  6. Pour the mixture into a 13 x 9-inch baking dish and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cheese on top is beginning to brown.
  7. Remove from the oven, let the pan sit for 3 to 5 minutes, and then serve with your favorite entree or lunch selection.
